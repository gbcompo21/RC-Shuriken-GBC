# RC-Shuriken-GameBoy Color
This is submission for the GBCompo21 Game Jam. It was made in the last 14 days of the 3 month jam.
I used the ZGB engine.
Play online from **[itch.io](https://healthpotionstudios.itch.io/rc-shuriken "itch.io")** or download the rom from the **Bin** folder on GitHub. You will need an emulator to play it.
